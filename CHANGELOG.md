# Changelog

## [4.0.0] - 2023-11-06

### Breaking Changes

- Reordered arguments for increased clarity in several classes:
  1. `LevelParameter`
  2. `TypeParameter`
  3. `SpecialValueType`
  4. `DateTimeType`
- Updated value types for parameters previously using `TextType` to `ParameterValueType` to enforce value specifications better.
- Dropped support for IANA tokens due to their large number. Use an x-name format for token names.
- No longer accept empty strings as `TextType` values.

### New Features

- Introduced a new value type: `ParameterValueType`, along with corresponding tests and type definitions.
- Added additional unit tests for `Tokenizer` and `Parser`.
- Included ts-doc comments in type definitions for improved documentation.
- Enabled case-insensitive string matching for arguments in `getProperty` and `getGroup` methods on the parse return object.
- Implemented unquoting of quoted values in `Tokenizer`.
- Validated `LanguageTagType` values and added tests for this type.

### Bug Fixes

- Allowed properties with `ALTID` parameter count as 1 for cardinality in `Parser`, `Group`, and `VCARD`.
- Permitted hyphens in x-names.
- Improved validation for `Group` names.
- Corrected the algorithm for finding the first colon index in `Tokenizer`.
- Fixed spelling and case issues in property identifier names in `VCARD` and `Group`.
